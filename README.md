Opportunity Sign Up and Completion Data - This dataset focuses on non-identifying user information related to learners who have engaged with specific opportunities on Excelerate.
Each row corresponds to a learner who has signed up for a particular opportunity.
As learners may sign up for multiple opportunities, there could be multiple rows with the same profile ID.
